    "Write a function $\\mathtt{svdcompress(X,b,p)}$ that performs block SVD compression. $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is devided into nonoverlapping $b\\times b$ blocks. For example, the first block is $\\mathtt{X(0:b,0:b)}$. A block $\\boldsymbol{A}$ should have its SVD computed. The singular values and $p$ are passed to the $\\mathtt{cutoff}$ function to determine a value of $k$ for the block. The corresponding approximation $\\boldsymbol{A}_{k}$ will occupy the same position in $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ as $\\boldsymbol{A}$ does in $\\boldsymbol{X}$.\n",

    "The number of scalars needed to define $\\boldsymbol{A}_{k}$ is $k(2b+1)$. Therefore, if $k\\ge b/2$, you should use $\\boldsymbol{A}$ rather than $\\boldsymbol{A}_{k}$ in the output $\\boldsymbol{Z}$, as it will be more efficient. In addition, along the bottom and right edges of the image there may be blocks whose width or height is smaller than $b$. Those can be copied directly into the output $\\boldsymbol{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also should keep a running total of the number of values needed to reconstruct $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ (that is, either $k(2b+1)$ or the number of elements in the block). At the end of the function, divide this total by the total number of elements in $\\boldsymbol{X}$ to get the output value $\\mathtt{ratio}$, which represents the compression ratio achieved. It should be no greater than one in all cases."
